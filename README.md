# Load

This data pack provides a simple implementation of version resolution similar
to that which is currently used by [Lantern]. It is purposefully unbranded,
dedicated to the public domain, and simple so as to be useful in as many cases
as possible. The hope is that the main standard libraries ([AESTD], [Lantern],
and [Phi]) make use of this scheme for maximum compatibility between the
competing standards.

## Notice

This data pack is currently not final, and may change depending on the
requirements of the AESTD and Phi projects. Currently, please do not bundle this
with your own data packs, except for evaluation purposes.

## License

This data pack is licensed under [CC0].
